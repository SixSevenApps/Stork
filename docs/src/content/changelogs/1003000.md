- **Support for status text**: Not only can you now set your status text, you can also see the
  status text of your friends, so you're always on the same page.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: We've added support for keyboard shortcuts to make your life easier. For
  the two of you that use a physical keyboard on Android, this one's for you.
- **Fixed so so many bugs**: They're all listed in the changelog, check out if your favourite bug
