title: Setting up your Development Environment
description: A guide to setting up your development environment for Revolt on Android.
template: doc
---

This page contains the guidelines for setting up your development environment for Revolt on Android. These guidelines are important to ensure that your development environment is set up correctly and you can start contributing to the project.

If you want to compile the app yourself, you can follow these guidelines. You may not need Android Studio, as it’s possible to build the app from the command line. GitHub Codespaces automates most of the process for you if you want to go that route and this guide covers those steps, but won’t go into detail on other command-line methods.

:::danger
It may be tempting to skip some of these steps, but make sure you follow them to ensure that your development environment is set up correctly.

Note: If you are doing this in Github Codespaces, steps 1-10 will be done for you. Also note that while small codespace instances can build this app, it's recommend to use 8-core or above for best results.

<Steps>

1.  Download the Git version control system.

    <Tabs syncKey="os">

    <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">

    ```powershell
    winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">

    Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

    ```zsh
    brew install git
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">

    Using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install git
    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

2.  Download Android Studio.

    <Tabs syncKey="os">

    <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">

    ```powershell
    winget install --id Google.AndroidStudio -e --source winget
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">

    From the [official website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">

    Look for Android Studio in your package manager.

    Alternatively, from [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/com.google.AndroidStudio) or the [official website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

3.  Download [Deno](https://deno.com).

    _Please see the [Deno Runtime Manual](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/) for installation guidance._

4.  Clone the repository.

    ```sh
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/revoltchat/android.git
    ```

    Specify `--recursive` to ensure that submodules are cloned as well.

5.  Open the project in Android Studio.

6.  Install the required dependencies.

    -   Android SDK, latest version
    -   Android NDK, latest version

    You can install these from the SDK Manager in Android Studio.

7.  Download required additional, embedded dependencies using the provided script.

    ```sh
    deno run -A scripts/download_deps.ts
    ```

8.  Copy the `revoltbuild.properties.example` file to `revoltbuild.properties` and fill in the required values.

    ```sh
    cp revoltbuild.properties.example revoltbuild.properties
    ```

    The `revoltbuild.properties` file contains the following properties:

    | Property                 | Description                                    |
    | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
    | `sentry.dsn`             | Sentry DSN for error reporting                 |
    | `sentry.upload_mappings` | Whether to upload obf. maps to Sentry          |
    | `build.debug.app_name`   | The name of the app in debug builds, arbitrary |
    | `build.flavour_id`       | Leave as `ZZUU`                                |

9.  Copy the `sentry.properties.example` file to `sentry.properties` and fill in the required values.

    ```sh
    cp sentry.properties.example sentry.properties
    ```

    The `sentry.properties` file contains the following properties:

    | Property           | Description                                              |
    | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `defaults.url`     | The URL of the Sentry instance                           |
    | `defaults.project` | The project ID in Sentry                                 |
    | `defaults.org`     | The organization ID in Sentry                            |
    | `auth.token`       | The authentication token for Sentry, used to upload maps |

    You can get these values from the Sentry dashboard.

10. Copy the `google-services.json.example` file within the `app` directory to `google-services.json`.

    Firebase services are integrated into the project, so we need a `google-services.json` file for the build to succeed. For development purposes, use the provided example file:

    ```sh
    cp app/google-services.json.example app/google-services.json
    ```

    :::note
    This is a mock configuration file for development purposes only. In a production environment, you would use a real Firebase project configuration.
    :::

11. Build the project.

    You can build the project by clicking on the 'Run' button in Android Studio.  
    If asked, build the `:app` module.

    If building within Github Codespaces, you can build a fresh debug apk by running `./gradlew assembledebug --no-daemon` from the root of the project. 
    Upon completion, the apk will be within `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

12. **You're all set!** You can now start contributing to Revolt on Android.
